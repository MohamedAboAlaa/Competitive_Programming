# Containers in C++ Standard Template Library (STL)

## Introduction
Containers are one of the fundamental components of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). They provide efficient ways to store and manage collections of data. Each container type is optimized for different use cases, ensuring flexibility and performance in C++ programs.

Containers can be broadly classified into three types:
1. **Sequence Containers** - Maintain elements in a linear order.
2. **Associative Containers** - Store elements in a structured key-value format.
3. **Unordered Containers** - Utilize hash tables for quick access.

## 1. Sequence Containers
Sequence containers store elements in a specific order, allowing sequential access and modifications.

### **Vector** (`std::vector`)
- A dynamic array that automatically resizes when elements are added or removed.
- Provides fast random access to elements (O(1) time complexity).
- Efficient when inserting or deleting elements from the end.
- Example use cases: Dynamic lists, buffers, stacks.

### **List** (`std::list`)
- A doubly linked list where elements are linked to their previous and next elements.
- Efficient for inserting and deleting elements at any position (O(1) insertion/deletion).
- Slow random access due to the need for traversal (O(n) access time).
- Example use cases: Implementing stacks, queues, and other data structures requiring frequent modifications.

### **Forward List** (`std::forward_list`)
- A singly linked list (unlike `std::list`, which is doubly linked).
- Uses less memory compared to `std::list`.
- Suitable for scenarios requiring minimal memory usage with sequential access.
- Example use cases: Implementing lightweight queues and stacks.

### **Deque** (`std::deque`)
- A double-ended queue that supports fast insertion and deletion at both ends.
- More flexible than `std::vector`, as it allows efficient front insertions.
- Example use cases: Task scheduling, buffers, history tracking.

## 2. Associative Containers
Associative containers store data in a sorted structure, allowing efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

### **Set** (`std::set`)
- Stores unique elements in a sorted order.
- Provides logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)) for insertion, deletion, and lookup.
- Example use cases: Unique word storage, filtering duplicates.

### **Multiset** (`std::multiset`)
- Similar to `std::set`, but allows duplicate elements.
- Useful when counting occurrences of elements is required.
- Example use cases: Frequency counting, multi-value storage.

### **Map** (`std::map`)
- Stores key-value pairs, where each key is unique and sorted.
- Provides efficient search and modification (O(log n)).
- Example use cases: Dictionaries, phone books, caches.

### **Multimap** (`std::multimap`)
- Similar to `std::map`, but allows multiple values per key.
- Example use cases: Storing students with multiple grades, event logs.

## 3. Unordered Containers
Unordered containers use **hash tables** instead of trees, making operations faster on average (O(1) complexity for insert, delete, and search).

### **Unordered Set** (`std::unordered_set`)
- Similar to `std::set` but does not store elements in sorted order.
- Provides O(1) average time complexity for search, insert, and delete.
- Example use cases: Fast lookups, duplicate filtering in large datasets.

### **Unordered Multiset** (`std::unordered_multiset`)
- Similar to `std::unordered_set`, but allows duplicate elements.
- Example use cases: Counting occurrences of words, fast multi-value storage.

### **Unordered Map** (`std::unordered_map`)
- Stores key-value pairs without maintaining any specific order.
- Allows O(1) average time complexity for search, insert, and delete.
- Example use cases: Hash tables, fast data lookup.

### **Unordered Multimap** (`std::unordered_multimap`)
- Similar to `std::unordered_map`, but allows multiple values per key.
- Example use cases: Storing records with duplicate keys, caching.

## Choosing the Right Container
Selecting the appropriate container depends on your specific needs:
- **Use `vector`** when frequent access and dynamic resizing are needed.
- **Use `list` or `forward_list`** when frequent insertions and deletions are required.
- **Use `deque`** when both ends need modification frequently.
- **Use `set` or `map`** when sorted storage and unique elements or key-value pairs are necessary.
- **Use `unordered_set` or `unordered_map`** when fast lookups are required without ordering constraints.
